This information includes location names, locations, menus, and even photos. Therefore, the positional platform of 5.0 will be used as the only data source since all of the required mandatory information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter finding a list of neighborhoods, we then connected to the Foursquare API to collect information about the locations within each neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we chose a radius of 100 meters.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contains information about places within a specified distance of longitude and latitude of postal code. Information collected on each location is as follows:\n\n1. Neighborhood\n    - Neighborhood latitude\n    - Neighborhood longitude \n2. Venue\n    - Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n    - Venue Latitude\n    - Venue Longitude\n    - Venue Category\n    \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n\nFolium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n\nScikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n\nJSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n\nXML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n\nGeocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n\nBeautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n\nMatplotlib: Python Plotting Module."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
